# Password Strength Meter & Password Generator

## 🔹 Technology Used

This project is built using **Streamlit** and **Python**.

## 🔹 Project Overview

The **Password Strength Meter** is a tool that evaluates the security of user passwords based on predefined criteria. It provides feedback and suggestions to help users create stronger passwords.

## 🔹 Features

### ✅ Password Strength Criteria

- Checks password length, character diversity, and complexity.
- Ensures uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters are included.

### ✅ Scoring System

- **Weak**: Password lacks multiple security features.
- **Moderate**: Decent security but missing key components.
- **Strong**: Highly secure password.

### ✅ Feedback System

- Provides instant feedback on missing security features.
- Suggests improvements for a more secure password.

### ✅ Suggest Strong Password

- Generates a random, strong password with a **click of a button**.
- Ensures password includes all security criteria.

### ✅ Blacklist Common Passwords

- Prevents the use of frequently used weak passwords (e.g., `password123`, `12345678`).
- Compares against a stored blacklist of common passwords.

### ✅ Password History Check

- Ensures the user does not reuse recently used passwords.
- Stores and verifies the last **10 passwords** for security.

### ✅ Auto-Fill Generated Password

- Automatically inserts the suggested password into the input field for convenience.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Enter a password** to check its strength.
2. **Receive a score** and security feedback.
3. **Click 'Suggest Password'** to generate a secure password.
4. **Ensure it’s unique** by avoiding previous passwords.

## 🔹 Future Enhancements

- **Integration with a database** for persistent password history.
- **Two-Factor Authentication** suggestions.
- **More advanced security checks** (e.g., detecting dictionary words).
